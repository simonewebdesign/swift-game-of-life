# Swift Game of Life

An implementation of Conway's Game of Life, written in [Swift](https://swift.org/).

All the logic lives in `Life.swift`, feel free to check it out. You can also clone this repo and fire it up on XCode.

Feel free to check out some of my other Game of Life implementations as well:
