# Swift Game of Life

An implementation of Conway's Game of Life, written in [Swift](https://swift.org/).

The logic that lives in `Life.swift` is actually broken and untested, and the `ViewController` is suboptimal (it would be nice to use `SpriteKit` instead of `UIKit` but whatever). In any case, feel free to check it out. Just clone this repo and fire it up on XCode. It should build successfully on iPhone XR.

By the way, feel free to check out some of my other implementations as well:

- 2012 - [JavaScript (DOM)](https://github.com/simonewebdesign/game-of-life)
- 2016 - [Elixir](https://github.com/simonewebdesign/elixir-game-of-life)
